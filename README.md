Why do I code?
So it is of course a professional matter, because as everybody knows, programmers earn a lot of money. But it is not the single factor. I also code, because I think, that I am capable finding solution for any problem. Maybe sometimes it is not very efficient, but I usually find it. Coding is also a pleasure in some way. I am always proud of my finished program, even if it is messy.
